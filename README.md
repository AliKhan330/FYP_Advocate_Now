Advocate Now

Advocate Now is a mobile application developed as a Final Year Project (FYP). The purpose of this project is to build a digital platform that bridges the gap between clients and advocates by providing a user-friendly, secure, and efficient system for communication and legal service management.

The app is designed to simplify the process of finding and connecting with advocates. Clients can easily register, log in, and explore advocate profiles, while advocates can manage their profiles and connect with potential clients. By using role-based dashboards, each user experiences the app according to their needs.

Project Description

The legal system is often complex for clients who do not have direct access to reliable advocates. Traditional methods of finding legal help can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Advocate Now addresses this issue by providing a centralized platform where:

Clients can search for advocates, view their expertise, and request consultations.

Advocates can create professional profiles, showcase their skills, and manage client requests.

Both clients and advocates have separate dashboards tailored to their roles.

Authentication ensures data security and prevents unauthorized access.

This project focuses on combining modern mobile app technology (Flutter) with real-time backend services (Firebase) to deliver a seamless experience.

Features

User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.

Role-Based Access: Separate dashboards for clients and advocates.

Advocate Profile Management: Advocates can add their details such as specialization, experience, and contact information.

Client Requests: Clients can approach advocates for consultation.

OTP Verification: Additional security layer for account creation.
